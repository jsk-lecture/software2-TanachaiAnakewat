Lowlatency カーネル:The low latency Ubuntu kernel is suitable for low-jitter workloads and industrial embedded applications with latency requirements in the milliseconds' range. Latency in an embedded system refers to the time elapsed when servicing a request, whereas jitter is the variability in the timing of an expected signal.
リアルタイム Linux:RTLinux provides the ability to run special real-time tasks and interrupt handlers on the same machine as standard Linux. These tasks and handlers execute when they need to execute no matter what Linux is doing.
POSIX:POSIX is a family of standards, specified by the IEEE, to clarify and make uniform the application programming interfaces (and ancillary issues, such as commandline shell utilities) provided by Unix-y operating systems.
並列処理:Parallel processing is a method of simultaneously breaking up and running program tasks on multiple microprocessors in order speed up performance time. Parallel processing may be accomplished with a single computer that has two or more processors (CPUs) or with multiple computer processors connected over a computer network. Parallel processing may also be referred to as parallel computing.
並行処理:Concurrent processing is a computing model in which multiple processors execute instructions simultaneously for better performance. Concurrent means, which occurs when something else happens. The tasks are broken into subtypes, which are then assigned to different processors to perform simultaneously, sequentially instead, as they would have to be performed by one processor. Concurrent processing is sometimes synonymous with parallel processing. 
スレッドセーフ:Thread safety is the avoidance of data races—situations in which data are set to either correct or incorrect values, depending upon the order in which multiple threads access and modify the data.
