丸め誤差:A rounding error, or round-off error, is a mathematical miscalculation or quantization error caused by altering a number to an integer or one with fewer decimals. Basically, it is the difference between the result of a mathematical algorithm that uses exact arithmetic and that same algorithm using a slightly less precise, rounded version of the same number or numbers. The significance of a rounding error depends on the circumstances.
打ち切り誤差:Truncation error is the difference between a truncated value and the actual value. A truncated quantity is represented by a numeral with a fixed number of allowed digits, with any excess digits "chopped off" (hence the expression "truncated").
情報落ち:Loss of significance occurs when two nearly equal numbers are subtracted to produce a result much smaller than either of the original numbers. The effect is that the number of accurate (significant) digits in the result may be reduced unacceptably.
桁落ち:Information dropout is an error that occurs when the information of a small value is ignored when adding or subtracting a large value and a small value.
bignum:This library is based on node-bigint by substack, but instead of using libgmp, it uses the builtin bignum functionality provided by OpenSSL. The advantage is that OpenSSL is already part of Node.js, so this library does not add any external dependency whatsoever.
