分散オブジェクト通信:n a distributed computing environment, distributed object communication realizes communication between distributed objects. The main role is to allow objects to access data and invoke methods on remote objects (objects residing in non-local memory space).

出版購読型モデルにおけるメッセージのフィルタリング:A Message Filter, as provided by this new feature, is configured on a Pub/Sub Subscription. It is a matching rule that is evaluated against each message’s defined attributes. Only messages that match the filter are sent to the subscribing service. The others are immediately auto-acknowledged. Auto-acknowledged messages never get sent to the service endpoint or pulled by a consuming service or job. For Filtering to work, the publishing service must be applying helpful attributes to the messages as they are published to the topic.
